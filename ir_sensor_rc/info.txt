i'm using a 10uF capacitor instead (was the only one that I could use)
and using a pair of IR transmiter/receiver (low distance)

Using a 100nf works really well! Last time with a til78, with a 1k Ohm Resistor I managed to get a great precision on 32-10 cm.
I still need to check if I can improve this distance. It would be nice to have gave at least 45-15)

Using 3 x 10nf I've managed to make a 45-15
